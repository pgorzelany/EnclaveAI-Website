  text: "I’ve tried lots of offline AI apps, even paid versions. Some of them were ridiculously slow, while the others crashing constantly. This is one of the best apps I’ve ever used. It’s very fast and accurate, even I use an Iphone 12 promax. So, it’s definitely deserves a go. Thanks for sharing this amazing app with us. It already takes place on my first page."
