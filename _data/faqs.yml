- question: Is my data private?
  answer: Yes, absolutely! All conversations happen locally on your device, and we don't collect or store any of your data. The AI model runs completely offline, which means your conversations, prompts, and any generated content never leave your device and are not shared with any third parties.

- question: What devices are supported?
  answer: The app is available for both Mac and iPhone. You can download it from the Mac App Store for your MacBook or desktop Mac, and from the iOS App Store for your iPhone. Both versions offer the same core privacy-focused AI experience, though with platform-specific optimizations.

- question: What's the difference between iOS and macOS versions?
  answer: Both versions now allow you to choose and download from a selection of AI models. The macOS version supports larger models due to greater computing power, while the iOS version offers models specifically optimized for mobile performance. Both versions maintain the same commitment to privacy and offline processing.

- question: Do I need an internet connection?
  answer: You only need internet for the initial download of the app and, on macOS, for downloading additional AI models. After that, everything works completely offline! This means you can use the app anywhere, anytime - whether you're on a plane, in a remote location, or simply prefer to work without an internet connection for enhanced privacy.

- question: How does offline AI work? Do I need internet connection?
  answer: No internet connection is required. The app downloads the AI model once during installation, and afterwards everything runs completely offline on your device. All processing, including voice recognition and text generation, happens locally without any data leaving your device.

- question: What kind of AI models does the app support?
  answer: Both iOS and macOS versions support various open-source large language models. On iOS, you can choose from models like Llama, Qwen, SmolLM, and Gemma - all optimized for mobile performance. The macOS version additionally supports larger models that take advantage of desktop computing power. All models are carefully optimized for their respective platforms to ensure smooth performance.

- question: Is my conversation data private?
  answer: Absolutely. Unlike cloud-based AI services, all your conversations stay on your device. We don't collect any data, require no account registration, and have no servers to store your information. Your privacy is guaranteed by design, not just by policy.

- question: How does voice chat work without internet?
  answer: We use Apple's on-device speech recognition and synthesis capabilities, combined with local AI models. This means your voice never leaves your device - everything from speech-to-text, AI processing, and text-to-speech happens locally.

- question: Can I use the AI features in my Shortcuts automation?
  answer: Yes! The app fully integrates with Apple Shortcuts on both iOS and macOS, allowing you to include AI capabilities in your automation workflows. You can process text, generate content, and even use voice commands through Siri - all while maintaining offline privacy.

- question: What's the difference between this and ChatGPT?
  answer: While ChatGPT processes everything in the cloud, our app runs AI models directly on your device. This means you maintain complete privacy, have no recurring subscription costs, and can use the AI features even without internet access. On macOS, you can even choose larger models that offer capabilities closer to cloud-based services.

- question: How does iMessage integration work?
  answer: The app adds an iMessage extension that lets you interact with the AI directly in your Messages app. You can get help composing messages, summarizing conversations, or generating responses - all processed locally on your device without sending your messages to any external servers.

- question: Will the app drain my battery?
  answer: The app is optimized to use Apple's Neural Engine efficiently on both platforms. On iOS, you can choose from several specially optimized models that balance capabilities with power consumption. On macOS, you have additional options for larger models. All models are optimized to make efficient use of your device's resources.

- question: How does the document context feature work?
  answer: The document context feature allows you to add PDF and text files directly into your chat conversations. When you add documents, they are processed entirely on your device - no cloud processing or internet connection required. You can then ask questions about the documents, request summaries, or analyze multiple documents together. Like all features in Enclave, document processing is completely private and offline, ensuring your sensitive documents never leave your device.
