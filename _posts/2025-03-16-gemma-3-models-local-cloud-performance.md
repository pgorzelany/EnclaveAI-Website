We're excited to announce that Enclave AI now supports Google's groundbreaking Gemma 3 family of models on iOS, with full macOS support coming soon. This integration brings unprecedented capabilities to your device while maintaining our unwavering commitment to privacy and offline processing.

### Cloud-Level Performance, Complete Privacy

The Gemma 3 family represents a remarkable achievement in AI efficiency. Despite having fewer parameters than many cloud-based models, Gemma 3 delivers competitive—and sometimes superior—performance across key benchmarks:

- **Powerful Reasoning**: Excels at complex reasoning tasks typically reserved for much larger models
- **Enhanced Factuality**: Provides accurate, reliable information with fewer hallucinations
- **Creative Capabilities**: Generates high-quality creative content comparable to cloud alternatives
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Achieves all this while running on a single accelerator

For Enclave users, this means you can now enjoy capabilities previously available only through cloud services, without compromising on privacy or requiring an internet connection.

### Available Now on iOS, Coming Soon to macOS

The Gemma 3 models are available now for all iOS users through the latest Enclave AI update. macOS users can look forward to full support across the entire Gemma 3 family in the coming weeks, taking advantage of the additional computing power available on Mac devices.

### Perfect for Shortcuts with Model Selection

This release comes at an ideal time, complementing our recently announced model selection feature for Apple Shortcuts. You can now create automations that leverage Gemma 3's powerful capabilities while maintaining complete privacy:

- Process complex documents with enhanced understanding
- Generate higher-quality creative content for automated workflows
- Analyze information with improved reasoning capabilities
- Maintain consistent performance across your automation tasks
