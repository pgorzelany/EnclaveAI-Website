We're excited to announce that Enclave AI now supports Google's groundbreaking Gemma 3 family of models on iOS, with full macOS support coming soon. This integration brings unprecedented capabilities to your device while maintaining our unwavering commitment to privacy and offline processing.

## Cloud-Level Performance, Complete Privacy

The Gemma 3 family represents a remarkable achievement in AI efficiency. Despite having fewer parameters than many cloud-based models, Gemma 3 delivers competitive—and sometimes superior—performance across key benchmarks:

- **Powerful Reasoning**: Excels at complex reasoning tasks typically reserved for much larger models
- **Enhanced Factuality**: Provides accurate, reliable information with fewer hallucinations
- **Creative Capabilities**: Generates high-quality creative content comparable to cloud alternatives
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Achieves all this while running on a single accelerator

For Enclave users, this means you can now enjoy capabilities previously available only through cloud services, without compromising on privacy or requiring an internet connection.

## Available Now on iOS, Coming Soon to macOS

The Gemma 3 models are available now for all iOS users through the latest Enclave AI update. macOS users can look forward to full support across the entire Gemma 3 family in the coming weeks, taking advantage of the additional computing power available on Mac devices.

## Perfect for Shortcuts with Model Selection

This release comes at an ideal time, complementing our recently announced [model selection feature for Apple Shortcuts](/blog/2025/03/09/advanced-shortcuts-model-selection/). You can now create automations that leverage Gemma 3's powerful capabilities while maintaining complete privacy:

- Process complex documents with enhanced understanding
- Generate higher-quality creative content for automated workflows
- Analyze information with improved reasoning capabilities
- Maintain consistent performance across your automation tasks
