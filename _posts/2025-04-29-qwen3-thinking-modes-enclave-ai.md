We are thrilled to announce the integration of the cutting-edge Qwen3 family of large language models into Enclave AI. This update brings powerful new capabilities, including innovative Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures and unique hybrid thinking modes, directly to your device while upholding our core commitment to absolute privacy.

### Advanced AI with Hybrid Thinking

Qwen3 represents a significant leap forward in AI development, offering models that balance performance, efficiency, and flexibility. Key highlights include:

- **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Architecture**: Models like Qwen3-30B-A3B deliver exceptional performance comparable to much larger models while activating only a fraction of their parameters (3 billion out of 30 billion total), making them ideal for efficient on-device processing.
- **Hybrid Thinking Modes**: Qwen3 introduces a novel approach allowing users to switch between:
    - **Thinking Mode**: The model reasons step-by-step for complex problems, providing deeper analysis.
    - **Non-Thinking Mode**: The model offers near-instant responses for quicker tasks.
    This flexibility, controllable within Enclave AI, allows you to tailor the AI's approach to your specific needs, balancing depth and speed.
- **Competitive Performance**: Qwen3 models demonstrate strong performance across benchmarks in coding, math, and general capabilities, rivaling top-tier models. Even smaller Qwen3 models show remarkable proficiency.
- **Extensive Multilingual Support**: With support for 119 languages and dialects, Qwen3 significantly expands Enclave AI's usability for users worldwide.

### What Qwen3 Means for Enclave AI Users

Integrating Qwen3 brings tangible advantages to your private AI experience:

**Enhanced Problem Solving**: Leverage the "Thinking Mode" for complex tasks requiring detailed reasoning, all performed securely on your device.
**Faster Interactions**: Switch to "Non-Thinking Mode" for rapid answers to simpler queries without sacrificing privacy.
**Greater Efficiency**: Benefit from the power of MoE models that deliver high-end performance without excessive resource drain on your device.
**Broader Language Access**: Interact with Enclave AI in a wider range of languages.

### Availability in Enclave AI

We are initially rolling out support for select Qwen3 models on iOS, with macOS support coming soon. We've optimized these models for the best possible on-device performance within Enclave AI's secure environment. iOS users can choose Qwen3 from the model selection menu, just like any other model.
