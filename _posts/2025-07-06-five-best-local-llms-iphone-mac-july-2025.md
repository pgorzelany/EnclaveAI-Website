The landscape of local AI has transformed dramatically in 2025, with powerful language models now running seamlessly on iPhones and Macs. From Apple's latest neural engines to the unified memory architecture of Apple Silicon, our devices have become capable AI powerhouses that rival cloud-based solutions while keeping your data completely private.

As we reach the middle of 2025, we're seeing a perfect storm of factors making local AI more compelling than ever: models are getting smaller and more efficient, Apple's hardware is more capable, and privacy concerns continue to drive demand for on-device processing.

After extensive research across app stores, model repositories, and performance benchmarks, here are the **5 best local LLMs** you can run on your iPhone and Mac right now.

## The Mobile-First Revolution: iPhone's Sweet Spot (Up to 4B Parameters)

iPhones, even the latest models, work best with models up to 4 billion parameters. This isn't a limitationâ€”it's a design choice that prioritizes battery life, thermal management, and responsive performance. The models in this range have become incredibly capable, often matching larger models in specific tasks while being perfectly optimized for mobile hardware.

## Mac's Unified Memory Advantage: Scaling to 32B+ Parameters

Mac's unified memory architecture changes everything for local AI. With models like the M4 Max supporting up to 128GB of unified memory, you can run models that would require expensive multi-GPU setups on traditional hardware. This opens the door to running 32B parameter models and beyond, bringing professional-grade AI capabilities to your desktop.

## 1. **Google Gemma 3n** - The Mobile-First Marvel

**Best for: iOS (2B-4B effective parameters) | Multimodal capabilities**

Google's [Gemma 3n](https://inventaai.com/gemma-3n-google-on-device-multimodal-ai-local-guide/) represents a breakthrough in mobile-first AI design. Despite having 8B total parameters (E4B variant), its innovative **MatFormer architecture** means only 4B parameters are active during inference, making it perfect for iPhone deployment.

### Why Gemma 3n Excels:
- **Multimodal by default**: Text, images, audio, and video processing in one model
- **Per-Layer Embeddings (PLE)**: Clever memory management that keeps core operations in NPU memory
- **KV Cache Sharing**: Cuts prompt processing time nearly in half
- **Real-time performance**: Runs at 60fps on devices like the iPhone 15 Pro

### Use Cases:
- **Visual assistance**: Describe scenes for accessibility applications
- **Real-time translation**: Process speech and translate on-device
- **Content creation**: Generate and edit content without cloud dependency
- **Meeting transcription**: Convert speech to text with speaker identification

Gemma 3n supports direct integration through Hugging Face and MLX frameworks, making it accessible through various local AI applications.
