The future of AI is not just powerful—it's portable. Today, we're thrilled to announce that Enclave AI now supports DeepSeek R1's distilled models, bringing advanced reasoning and problem-solving capabilities right to your iOS device while maintaining complete privacy.

### The Power of DeepSeek R1 Meets Enclave

DeepSeek R1, the groundbreaking open-source AI model developed at a remarkably efficient cost of $5.58 million, has disrupted the AI landscape with its exceptional performance in mathematics, coding, and reasoning tasks. Through Enclave AI, you can now harness this powerful technology directly on your iPhone, iPad or Mac, with no need for cloud connectivity or data sharing.

### Understanding Model Distillation

Model distillation is an innovative technique that makes powerful AI models like DeepSeek R1 accessible on mobile devices. Think of it as creating a highly efficient student model that learns from a more complex teacher model. Through careful training and optimization, these student models capture the essential knowledge and capabilities of their larger counterparts while requiring significantly less computational power. It's similar to how a skilled apprentice learns from a master craftsman, eventually performing the same tasks with equal precision but with more efficient movements.
