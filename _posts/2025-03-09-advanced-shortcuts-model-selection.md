We're excited to announce a major enhancement to Enclave AI's integration with Apple Shortcuts: the ability to select specific AI models for your automations. This powerful update, now available on both iOS and macOS, gives you unprecedented control over your AI-powered workflows.

## The Power of Choice in Your Automations

Until now, Enclave AI's Shortcuts integration has allowed you to leverage AI in your automations using the default model. With our latest update, you can now:

- Specify exactly which AI model to use for each automation
- Choose between local models for complete privacy or cloud models for enhanced capabilities
- Create different shortcuts for different use cases, each with the ideal model for the task
- Maintain consistent performance across your iOS and macOS devices

This flexibility transforms how you can integrate AI into your daily workflows, allowing you to build more sophisticated and purpose-driven automations.

## Local and Cloud Models at Your Command

The new model selection feature works seamlessly with our recent [OpenRouter integration](/blog/2025/02/26/openrouter-integration-best-of-both-worlds/), giving you access to both local and cloud models in your shortcuts:

**Local Models for Privacy-Critical Tasks**
- Process sensitive information with complete privacy
- Create automations that work offline, anywhere
- Ensure consistent performance regardless of internet connectivity
- Maintain zero data sharing for confidential workflows

**Cloud Models for Advanced Capabilities**
- Tap into more powerful models for complex tasks
- Access specialized models for specific domains
- Utilize the latest frontier models for cutting-edge capabilities
- Scale up processing power for demanding workflows

## Cross-Platform Consistency

With the expansion of enhanced shortcuts to macOS, you can now create consistent automation experiences across all your Apple devices:

- Build a shortcut once and use it on both your iPhone and Mac
- Maintain workflow continuity as you move between devices
- Leverage the same model selection capabilities regardless of platform
- Create device-specific optimizations while maintaining the same core functionality

## Real-World Automation Scenarios

The combination of model selection and cross-platform shortcuts opens up powerful new possibilities. If you're new to AI automation, start with our [guide to maximizing productivity with AI shortcuts](/blog/2024/03/01/maximizing-productivity-with-ai-shortcuts/).

**Intelligent Email Processing**
Create a shortcut that uses a privacy-focused local model to categorize and summarize incoming emails, then optionally processes important messages with a more powerful cloud model for detailed analysis and response drafting.

**Multi-Stage Document Workflow**
Build an automation that uses a specialized local model to extract key information from documents, then routes complex analysis tasks to a domain-specific cloud model, all while maintaining appropriate privacy controls.

**Context-Aware Content Creation**
Develop shortcuts that select different models based on the content type you're creating—using efficient local models for straightforward tasks and more powerful cloud options for creative or technical content.

**Adaptive Research Assistant**
Create a research workflow that begins with local models for initial information gathering and organization, then seamlessly transitions to specialized cloud models for deeper analysis of non-sensitive material.

**Privacy-Conscious Data Processing**
Build a shortcut that automatically anonymizes sensitive data using a local model before sending the sanitized information to a cloud model for advanced processing, ensuring privacy while maximizing capabilities.

## Setting Up Model Selection in Your Shortcuts

Adding model selection to your shortcuts is straightforward:

1. When creating a new shortcut with Enclave AI actions, you'll now see a "Model" parameter
2. Tap this parameter to view available models, categorized as Local or Cloud
3. Select your preferred model for the specific task
4. Complete your shortcut configuration as usual

For existing shortcuts, you can easily update them to take advantage of model selection by editing the shortcut and selecting your preferred model.

## The Future of AI Automation

This update represents a significant step forward in our vision for AI-powered automation—one where you have complete control over both capabilities and privacy. By combining the flexibility of model selection with the power of Apple Shortcuts, we're creating an environment where AI truly adapts to your specific needs and preferences.

In the coming months, we'll be expanding these capabilities further with additional shortcut actions, more granular control options, and enhanced integration with other Apple ecosystem features.
