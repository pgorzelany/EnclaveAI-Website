We're thrilled to announce a highly requested feature that enhances both productivity and privacy: local conversation history in Enclave AI. Starting today, you can access, review, and continue your previous conversations—all while maintaining our unwavering commitment to privacy through complete local storage.

### Your Conversations, Preserved and Protected

Until now, Enclave AI has focused on providing powerful, in-the-moment AI assistance without storing conversation data. While this approach maximized privacy, many users expressed a desire to revisit valuable conversations and continue discussions where they left off.

We've listened to your feedback and developed a solution that preserves both functionality and privacy: all your conversations are now automatically saved locally on your device. This means you can:

- Access your complete conversation history at any time
- Continue previous discussions without starting from scratch
- Reference important information from past interactions
- Organize and manage your conversations for better productivity

Most importantly, your conversation data never leaves your device—it's stored locally using secure, encrypted storage that only you can access.

### Complete Control Over Your Data

Privacy isn't just about where data is stored—it's also about who controls it. With our new conversation history feature, you maintain complete control over your data:

- **Delete Individual Conversations**: Remove specific conversations that are no longer needed
- **Clear All History**: One-tap option to delete your entire conversation history
- **Export Capabilities**: Save important conversations in standard formats for your records
- **No Cloud Sync**: Your conversations stay on your device and are never uploaded to any server

This approach ensures that you get the benefits of conversation persistence without compromising on privacy or security.

### Practical Benefits for Everyday Use

The addition of conversation history transforms how you can use Enclave AI in your daily workflow:

**Continuity Across Sessions**  
Start a complex project in the morning, close the app for meetings, and pick up exactly where you left off in the afternoon—complete with all context and previous exchanges.

**Knowledge Management**  
Build a personal knowledge base through your conversations. When you need to reference information from a previous discussion, it's just a few taps away.

**Project Organization**  
Group related conversations by project or topic, making it easier to maintain context across multiple sessions and track progress over time.

**Learning and Improvement**  
Review past interactions to see how you've refined your prompts and questions over time, helping you become more effective at working with AI.

### Looking Forward

The addition of local conversation history represents an important evolution in Enclave AI's capabilities. By preserving the context and content of your interactions while maintaining our core privacy principles, we're creating an AI assistant that truly adapts to your needs and workflow.

In the coming months, we'll be expanding on this foundation with additional features like conversation tagging, advanced search capabilities, and enhanced organization tools—all while keeping your data completely private and under your control.

### Try It Today

The conversation history feature is available now in the latest update of Enclave AI for both iOS. Simply update your app to start benefiting from this new capability. Your existing conversations will automatically begin being saved locally, and you'll find a new "History" section in the app where you can browse, continue, or manage your past interactions.
