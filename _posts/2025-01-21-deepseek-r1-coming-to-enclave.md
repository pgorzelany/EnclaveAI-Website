We're thrilled to announce that DeepSeek R1, a groundbreaking open source AI model, will soon be available in Enclave AI for both iOS and macOS. This addition represents a significant advancement in local AI capabilities, particularly for users who need strong reasoning, mathematics, and coding abilities while maintaining complete privacy.

### What Makes DeepSeek R1 Special?

Released under the MIT license, DeepSeek R1 stands out for its exceptional reasoning capabilities and impressive performance across various benchmarks. The model demonstrates human-like reasoning abilities, making it particularly effective for complex tasks like coding, mathematics, and analytical thinking.

Some notable achievements include:
- 79.8% score on AIME 2024 mathematics tests
- 97.3% accuracy on MATH-500
- 2,029 rating on Codeforces (outperforming 96.3% of human programmers)
- 90.8% accuracy on MMLU (demonstrating broad knowledge)

### Perfect for Local Processing

What makes DeepSeek R1 especially exciting for Enclave users is its availability in various sizes, from 1.5B to 70B parameters. These different versions are optimized for efficiency, making them ideal for local processing on different devices. The smaller models run smoothly on mobile devices, while the larger versions take full advantage of desktop computing power.

### Enhanced Privacy Through Local Processing

While the cloud version of DeepSeek R1 (when run in China) may have certain content restrictions, running the model locally in Enclave removes these limitations. This aligns perfectly with our commitment to privacy and local processing, ensuring you have complete control over your AI interactions.

### Real-World Applications

DeepSeek R1 excels in several areas that will benefit Enclave users:

**Advanced Mathematics**
- Complex problem-solving
- Mathematical reasoning
- Step-by-step solutions
- Formula derivation

**Professional Coding**
- Code generation and analysis
- Debugging assistance
- Algorithm optimization
- Technical documentation

**Analytical Reasoning**
- Logical problem-solving
- Decision analysis
- Pattern recognition
- Complex data interpretation

### Coming Soon to Enclave

We're currently optimizing DeepSeek R1 for both iOS and macOS, ensuring smooth performance across all Apple devices. The integration will maintain our commitment to:
- Complete privacy through local processing
- No internet connection required
- No data collection or tracking
- Full user control over the AI

### Why This Matters

The addition of DeepSeek R1 to Enclave represents more than just new features - it's about providing our users with more powerful tools while maintaining absolute privacy. Whether you're a developer working on confidential code, a student solving complex math problems, or a professional analyzing sensitive data, DeepSeek R1 will enhance your capabilities while keeping your work completely private.

### Looking Forward
