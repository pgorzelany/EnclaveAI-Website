We're thrilled to announce that DeepSeek R1, a groundbreaking open source AI model, will soon be available in Enclave AI for both iOS and macOS. This addition represents a significant advancement in local AI capabilities, particularly for users who need strong reasoning, mathematics, and coding abilities while maintaining complete privacy.

## What Makes DeepSeek R1 Special?

Released under the MIT license, DeepSeek R1 stands out for its exceptional reasoning capabilities and impressive performance across various benchmarks. The model demonstrates human-like reasoning abilities, making it particularly effective for complex tasks like coding, mathematics, and analytical thinking.

Some notable achievements include:
- 79.8% score on AIME 2024 mathematics tests
- 97.3% accuracy on MATH-500
- 2,029 rating on Codeforces (outperforming 96.3% of human programmers)
- 90.8% accuracy on MMLU (demonstrating broad knowledge)

## Perfect for Local Processing

What makes DeepSeek R1 especially exciting for Enclave users is its availability in various sizes, from 1.5B to 70B parameters. These different versions are optimized for efficiency, making them ideal for local processing on different devices. The smaller models run smoothly on mobile devices, while the larger versions take full advantage of desktop computing power. For a deeper understanding of how parameter count affects performance, check out our [guide to understanding model sizes](/blog/2024/05/13/understanding-llm-model-sizes/).

## Enhanced Privacy Through Local Processing

While the cloud version of DeepSeek R1 (when run in China) may have certain content restrictions, running the model locally in Enclave removes these limitations. This aligns perfectly with our commitment to privacy and local processing, ensuring you have complete control over your AI interactions.

## Real-World Applications

DeepSeek R1 excels in several areas that will benefit Enclave users. Discover more ways AI can transform your workflow in our overview of [professional use cases for local AI](/blog/2025/01/16/professional-use-cases-local-ai/).
