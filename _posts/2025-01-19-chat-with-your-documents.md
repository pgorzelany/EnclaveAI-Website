We're excited to announce a transformative new feature in Enclave AI that's changing how users interact with their documents. Now you can add PDF and text documents directly into your chat context, enabling rich, contextual conversations about your content while maintaining complete privacy through local processing. This enhancement opens up new possibilities for document analysis, research, and professional work - all while keeping your sensitive information secure on your device.

### A New Way to Work with Documents

Imagine having a knowledgeable assistant who can read and understand your documents instantly, helping you extract insights, find specific information, and make connections between different texts. That's what our new document context feature brings to Enclave AI. Whether you're reviewing a research paper, analyzing a contract, or studying complex technical documentation, you can now have meaningful conversations about your documents while maintaining complete privacy.

The process is beautifully simple: tap the attachment icon, select your documents, and watch as they're processed locally on your device. Within moments, you can start asking questions and receiving insights based on your documents' content. Since everything happens offline, your sensitive information never leaves your device.

### Real-World Applications

The ability to have private conversations with your documents opens up powerful possibilities across many fields. In legal work, you can analyze case documents and contracts while maintaining attorney-client privilege. Add multiple case files to your chat context and explore legal principles, precedents, and relationships between cases - all while keeping sensitive information completely private.

For academic research and study, this feature transforms how you can interact with scholarly materials. When reviewing research papers, you can quickly grasp key findings, methodologies, and conclusions. You can compare different papers on the same topic, identify gaps in the literature, and generate comprehensive summaries - perfect for literature reviews or staying current in your field.

Medical professionals can use this feature to review treatment guidelines, medical literature, and patient records while maintaining strict HIPAA compliance. Since all processing happens locally, you can safely analyze sensitive medical information, compare treatment protocols, and stay updated on the latest research without any privacy concerns.

In the business world, this feature enables secure analysis of financial reports, market research, and internal documents. You can extract trends from quarterly reports, analyze competitive research, and process confidential business plans while ensuring your sensitive data never leaves your device. Ask questions about year-over-year changes, market conditions, or specific business metrics - your AI assistant will help you spot patterns and insights while maintaining complete data privacy.

### Professional Workflows Transformed

In the business world, financial analysts are finding new ways to extract insights from reports and market research. One analyst described their experience: "I used to spend hours scanning through quarterly reports to spot trends. Now I can add multiple reports to the chat and ask specific questions about year-over-year changes or market conditions. The AI helps me spot patterns I might have missed, and I can be confident that our sensitive financial data stays private."

For healthcare professionals, the feature offers a secure way to review patient records and medical literature. A physician explained how they use it to compare treatment guidelines with patient histories, ensuring they consider all relevant factors while maintaining strict patient confidentiality. Since all processing happens locally, they can be confident they're meeting HIPAA requirements.

### The Power of Private Document Analysis

What makes this feature truly special is its commitment to privacy. In a world where sensitive documents are routinely uploaded to cloud services for analysis, Enclave's local processing approach stands out. Your documents remain solely on your device, processed by our efficient local AI models. This means you can work with confidential information, personal data, and sensitive business documents without worry.

### Getting Started

Ready to transform how you work with documents? Update Enclave AI to the latest version and try the new document context feature. Start with a single document - perhaps a research paper you're studying or a contract you're reviewing. Ask questions, request summaries, and explore connections within the text. You'll quickly discover how this feature can enhance your workflow while keeping your information private and secure.

Remember, your documents never leave your device. They're processed locally, analyzed privately, and kept completely under your control. That's the Enclave promise: powerful AI assistance without compromising on privacy.

### Conclusion

The addition of document context to Enclave AI represents more than just a new feature - it's a fundamental shift in how we can interact with our documents while maintaining privacy. Whether you're a student, professional, researcher, or business leader, you now have a powerful tool for document analysis that respects your privacy and keeps your information secure.
